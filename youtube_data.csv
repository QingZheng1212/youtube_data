Zack Kcaz,25/12/20 01:58:23,35,no,no,"""Jesus actually wasn't born December 25th. Christmas trees, stockings & the exchange of gifts is a Roman tradition to celebrate the winter solstice. The first recorded Christmas celebration was in Rome on Dec 25th, AD 336 after Constantine converted to Christianity. It's ALL PAGAN!""

Zack Kcaz,25/12/20 03:35:51,1,no,no,"@Lyla Rish In Jeremiah it talks about the foolishness of the people for cutting a tree down, bringing into their home, nailing it to the floor & decorating it with silver & gold etc. It's an idol that you kneel before & teach children to do the same.  Placing children on Santa's (Satan) lap refers back to Molech & child sacrifice. Look it up. Think about what Christmas is about. Staring at & worshipping lights & gifts. Seek the Most High Almighty God & He will guide you. The majority if Christian's do not obey & follow Him & are deceived.",view comment
Zack Kcaz,25/12/20 03:35:35,0,no,no,@nicole montesano It's time you learn what Christmas really is. Saturnalia. And who the worship goes to. Nimrod. Satan. You have to stand before the Almighty regarding this.,view comment

This has by far been one of the hardest years for me and many others , and i just want to say even though i don't know you guys just from human to human i am proud of everyone, proud that you have overcome challenges, adapted to new things and learned to live through a global pandemic. Yes covid isn't over and yes you must still wear masks and social distance but give yourselves a pat on the back you have survived so much!! And to Nat, i know we don't know each other personally but i have seen you grow so much and blossom into such an amazing woman , you are so kind hearted and selfless and i aspire to be as successful in all aspects of life as you are! and congrats on doing such an amazing vlogmas this year!

Elizabeth Miller,22/12/20 16:11:43,1,no,no,"UGH Zoe's vlogs are just the best aren't they??? She's just the most wonderful person and resonates happiness. Her vlogs and older videos have been a lifesaver for me this year (as I'm sure for a lot of people as well!). 
Back in January my dad was diagnosed with stage 4 glioblastoma and it was such a rough journey. He had surgery to remove most of the tumor and then he was admitted to a long term nursing home facility for rehab/chemo/radiation. But, unfortunately he passed back in August. It was SO hard as I wasn't able to see him much due to COVID. Whenever I needed an escape I would pull up Zoe's videos and cycle though a couple. It helped so much!
Now, my family recently learned my mom has cancer, though we aren't sure what type yet. She will have her scans on the 28th. Hoping it is treatable and that in the new year we can get things rolling for that. So, again Zoe's videos are helping take my mind off things when my anxiety gets to be too much.
I hope all are doing well and staying safe! Happy Holidays everyone. 
(And Zoe, if you by chance see this..... thanks for being you. You're the best!)",view comment

I live in South Wales and as you said we are going into a full lockdown and tbh its shit. All the shops that aren't food shops have closed down right before christmas and along with that none of the supermarkets aren't allowed to serve anything that isn't food, because it's considered not essential, so for people who haven't finished their christmas shop, its awful. Mark Drakeford didn't give any time for people to prepare and not only that he got everyone's hopes up only to smash them into tiny pieces.",view comment

Sarah __xoxo,22/12/20 16:23:43,37,no,no,"Honestly Zoe, im am feeling so down and alone. i know there are many people in my situation but when i contact my family and they ignore me or dont reply that just upsets me even more because im trying to reach out to them and see how they are, making sure they are okay and to feel so distant from them and leaving with my parents and brother who when i want to spend family time with them its always ur bored, and they dont want to be there doing something with me, i have so many family problems going off and im just in the middle of it all and im stressing, worrying, overthinking and just feeling so alone and lonely because i message people everyday to see how they are and just get ignored and left on read. i just try to keep myself busy but once ive done everything i have nothing left to do and then im on my phone and with lockdown and everything happening i'm feeling the pressure to be more inside and there isnt much to do in my house as its small but not small if you get it.  i have explained to people how i feel and i get advice but then im going in circles. i must say your videos and marks videos have helped me put a smile on my face and just forget about everything and just spend some time on me.  thank you x",view comment

But since my grandfather is 85 he will not be able to spend christmas with us, and that breaks my heart tbh. We were supposed to spend christmas eve with all of my cousins, my uncle, his wife, her kids, my aunt, grandfather etc, so this sucks.

Ella HB,22/12/20 16:41:32,1,no,no,Don't ever stop!! You're amazing and the way you make us all feel is so nice in these times!! I live in wales and we're in full lockdown. I  finish isolation rom having covid tomorrow. My boyfriend has had to isolate in his bedroom for the past 10 days and it's just so horrible being away from him!  I'm grateful i can have Christmas with my family and then on boxing day I'm going to finish lockdown at my boyfriend's house. Such a horrible time for everyone and it breaks my heart that so many people have it so much worse. Your videos have really helped me get through covid so thank you!!! Love to everyone having a horrible time. Here's to 2021!!!,view comment

And I don't mean to put any pressure on you! It's no big deal if you skip days, and it's ALWAYS fun no matter how little actually happens in them I promise.

I know I should be grateful that I handled it well and that the loss of my smell isn't that bad but I'm sad and I can't taste any of my comforting food is so frustrating.

JadeDoesDisney,22/12/20 17:02:28,9,no,no,"This year has been the absolute worst. We lost my Grandad to covid back in May, we were so so close and hadn’t seen each other for 3 months in person so it was absolutely heartbreaking. I had to drive to his funeral on my own and drive myself home on my own (they were unable to provide us with a funeral car due to covid). A month later we lost our family dog (my Grandad’s best friend) due to him having a stroke (we also believe this was linked to my grandad passing). It’s been so difficult in the run up to Christmas and then last week I was made redundant from my job. 

Sitting around the Christmas table with an empty seat this year will be so so hard but we’ll get through it. 
Thank you for still doing vlogmas this year, it really brings a bit of joy to the hard days 💖",view comment

She usually doesn't like Christmas, but this year she is buying a lot of decorations and we made gingerbread houses in November becaue she said she wants to celebrate early. Which makes me think that she feels bad for last year. Idk maybe I'm just overthinking it",view comment

I think there are a bunch of names for them, but that’s what we called them ever since I was little.  : cream 1cup butter and 1/4 cup confectioners sugar. Add 2 tsp vanilla extract and 1 tbsp water. Add 2 cups flour and mix well. Add 1 cup chopped pecans. (I chop super fine in the food processor) form the dough into small balls and bake on an ungreased cookie sheet 300 degrees for 20 min. While still hot roll in confectioners sugar. My all time favorite since I was old enough to eat cookies. 🥰😋 the trick is to finely chop the pecans.",view comment

And this years new one I think it’s called “timeless Christmas” and “Christmas in Vienna” were good!  Sometimes you can find hallmark movies on you tube but sometimes the sounds cuts out for a few min due to copyright. You’re cookies look delicious!,view comment

MELTING MOMENTS   1 cup of margarine ( softened) * not melted. 3/4 cup corn starch ( sifted)   1/2 cup powdered sugar  ( sifted) 1 cup plus 1 tablespoon Flour ( sifted)   Cream Margarine. Add corn starch , powdered sugar & flour. Mix until blended. Chill for 1 hour in the freg. Roll in ball, size of a quarter. Place on a ungreased cookie sheet. Bake at 350* for 20-25 min. Or until slightly brown. Rotate after 10 min. & finish baking. When they are completely cooled drizzle with a powdered sugar glaze and you can sprinkle with Christmas sprinkles when the glaze is still wet. ENJOY! 🎄 P.S. You could probably dump & go with these too 🤓",view comment

Heres the link to the recipes I use...you can even cut corners with santa surprise by using a pnut butter cookie mix...just make sure you refrigerate the dough a couple of hours before cooking.

The mint ones look yummy...I may have to try those.

Also line your pans with parchment paper...I literally pull the whole sheet off the pan onto the cooling rack and add a new sheet for each batch...clean up is a breeze.",view comment
Sweet Pea,14/12/20 20:07:36,0,no,no,What a cute video today Crystal. All that baking is a lot of work. It takes a lot of different things that I don’t have room for to make cookies. The kids look so cute in their cooking aprons. Thank you so much for taking us along to look at Christmas lights. There were some beautifully decorated homes on your trip. We haven’t done that yet this year and I hope to. We didn’t get to do it last year ☺️🎄👍🏻,view comment

Why not roll out the filling of the nut roll and roll out the caramel, place the white filling on the caramel and roll, then roll in the peanuts or pecans. You will have to move quick so the caramel won't harden quickly. May help.",view comment

This year has been rubbish. Just lucky that my family and friends are all healthy. Even if we are not going to get a normal Christmas. First Christmas in 20+ years that it’s only going to be the 4 of us for Christmas dinner. But we are healthy and well.",view comment

Elizabeth Miller,22/12/20 16:11:43,1,no,no,"UGH Zoe's vlogs are just the best aren't they??? She's just the most wonderful person and resonates happiness. Her vlogs and older videos have been a lifesaver for me this year (as I'm sure for a lot of people as well!). 
Back in January my dad was diagnosed with stage 4 glioblastoma and it was such a rough journey. He had surgery to remove most of the tumor and then he was admitted to a long term nursing home facility for rehab/chemo/radiation. But, unfortunately he passed back in August. It was SO hard as I wasn't able to see him much due to COVID. Whenever I needed an escape I would pull up Zoe's videos and cycle though a couple. It helped so much!
Now, my family recently learned my mom has cancer, though we aren't sure what type yet. She will have her scans on the 28th. Hoping it is treatable and that in the new year we can get things rolling for that. So, again Zoe's videos are helping take my mind off things when my anxiety gets to be too much.
I hope all are doing well and staying safe! Happy Holidays everyone. 
(And Zoe, if you by chance see this..... thanks for being you. You're the best!)",view comment

All the shops that aren't food shops have closed down right before christmas and along with that none of the supermarkets aren't allowed to serve anything that isn't food, because it's considered not essential, so for people who haven't finished their christmas shop, its awful.

It doesn't make me feel jealous, it makes me hopeful that next year, once my family is properly vaccinated that we'll be able to come together to mourn our lost loved ones and celebrate their lives properly like we were unable to this year. Please continue to do what you do. Your videos make so many people happy and bring them joy. I hope your holiday is great and I hope anyone that reads this has a great holiday too.",view comment

Megan Cantz,22/12/20 16:21:57,1,no,no,Your videos are providing a small sense of normalcy for me which I think we could use among the craziness. Over here in the US they haven’t imposed any new restrictions where I live and cases are still just rising and it’s looking pretty bleak. I’m self isolating at my moms away from my bf whom I normally live with. It feels so strange being apart this year but I just wanted to be with my mom for a little bit since I hadn’t seen her in 4 months.,view comment

Sarah __xoxo,22/12/20 16:23:43,37,no,no,"Honestly Zoe, im am feeling so down and alone. i know there are many people in my situation but when i contact my family and they ignore me or dont reply that just upsets me even more because im trying to reach out to them and see how they are, making sure they are okay and to feel so distant from them and leaving with my parents and brother who when i want to spend family time with them its always ur bored, and they dont want to be there doing something with me, i have so many family problems going off and im just in the middle of it all and im stressing, worrying, overthinking and just feeling so alone and lonely because i message people everyday to see how they are and just get ignored and left on read. i just try to keep myself busy but once ive done everything i have nothing left to do and then im on my phone and with lockdown and everything happening i'm feeling the pressure to be more inside and there isnt much to do in my house as its small but not small if you get it.  i have explained to people how i feel and i get advice but then im going in circles. i must say your videos and marks videos have helped me put a smile on my face and just forget about everything and just spend some time on me.  thank you x",view comment

But since my grandfather is 85 he will not be able to spend christmas with us, and that breaks my heart tbh.

And I don't mean to put any pressure on you! It's no big deal if you skip days, and it's ALWAYS fun no matter how little actually happens in them I promise.

We lost my Grandad to covid back in May, we were so so close and hadn’t seen each other for 3 months in person so it was absolutely heartbreaking. I had to drive to his funeral on my own and drive myself home on my own (they were unable to provide us with a funeral car due to covid). A month later we lost our family dog (my Grandad’s best friend) due to him having a stroke (we also believe this was linked to my grandad passing). It’s been so difficult in the run up to Christmas and then last week I was made redundant from my job. 

Sitting around the Christmas table with an empty seat this year will be so so hard but we’ll get through it.

We are D & V Orozco,25/12/20 00:41:34,1,no,no,"This is a “family channel” yet the work Austin showed of that guy’s Instagram definitely shouldn’t be something you find on a family channel! “So you guys’ll be the first to see it”💀 the logic since we’ll be viewing this video after it happens- untrue & dumb. Her face/ head & hands/fingers look chubby in that painting. Also the hands together like that look so weird. It’s so excessively big & ridiculous. Don’t see how that’s so meaningful or how you want to pass this down do you kids.. worthless🤣 as if she doesn’t already think the world revolves around her; that’s tacky to have a pic that big of just part of the family let alone one person. Lailai didn’t want to see it at first. “My shirt’s dirty” sweetie.. that’s not a shirt it’s a very cropped t-shirt that’s basically a glorified bra at this point! Most facials aren’t supposed to make your face that red. & no most of us don’t know how it is to spoil ourselves with a facial. Way to litter, Austin! Even with her mom there they still leave her out at first- shame! Let her ass in the car; rude. When you’re obsessed with yourself. Can’t believe they wasted so much money on her. Yeah, if she has kids. Only part I liked was his mom’s hoodie. You really are trying to have a museum & not a house! His mom saying that was one of the best purchases; tells me she’s not that good with money. As if people don’t obsess over Katherine enough already. She needs a reality check on her ego boost. I wouldn’t want anything that big in my place & unless you have a house that massive size then you wouldn’t either.",view comment

Abygail Jimenez,25/12/20 01:24:53,1,no,no,Before Austin said it 2:00 - 2:04 I already knew what he was trying to say because I am the same exact way. I feel as though 1 gift isn't good enough or that particular thing I got someone isn't enough therefore I get everything to make my loved ones happy. But honestly this gift you gave catherine is beautiful and very meaningful. You did good Austin🧡💚💙❤️💗👏👏👏👏,view comment

Well I wish to share just a little with the family,I know this is a love and family blog and there is actually no harm in making legit money especially as the world is changing to digital currency,there is no better place to talk to a great congregation about Forex trading and the huge profits i have made personally within a period of time. It's a huge sum of my passive income and has been an eventful one.
I started with less than $50000 and my portfolio has grown to $85k, courtesy of my broker Mr George Williams,his intriguing strategies are profitable.
Mates you don't need to wait till you have so much before you can invest! It gives everyone the opportunity to invest and make huge profits especially now that BTC is on the high side!Guys by 2021 you would wish you invested in Bitcoin now,take that bold step now and contact expert Broker Mr George Williams.

Whit Stone,25/12/20 16:40:13,2,no,no,"I did tear up go up a couple of comments let me tell you something I really feel that we are all raising our vibration please share the comment or get it to Catherine I know that she's going to see it what I wrote a couple of comments above you is so important for all of you know that we all have an inner purpose and an inner fire that we have forgotten about because we have been brainwashed and conditioned by society standards whoever runs this global world and it is true that that's happening it's not a conspiracy theory it's ridiculous and they have divided us and subconsciously even if logically we know that that hasn't happened it has so you have to retrain your brain literally and it's going to feel funny at first because you will feel silly but guess what just continue to doit I want everyone to know that they can have exactly what this family has and that's what that family wants so I'm making a channel to break it down on how to do it and telling my life story first my name is Whitney.. I want to talk about my addiction my losing my son to Sid's losing my the father of my children to he committed suicide the love of my life, also I want to talk about my beautiful son that I had my rainbow child and he was taken from me without you know my will I've been still fighting for him and the corruption in the family court system and the whole justice system.. it's awful but I promise you what do you think I should basically I want to talk about truth but can you think of a clever name because I'm not going to put all my eggs in one basket I want to sell things on Etsy I want to make things I want to I've already started a business I'm investing but I just want to know to do on all platforms so can anyone think of anything? People call me Whit so I was thinking okay Whitney went what rhymes with that and what can you think of any creative clever channel names that's short and sweet and to the point but wraps all that up into one? Like that's my life but I want also to help others so I'm trying to give you some info on what I am doing or you know so that cuz I've already actually filmed my first video I just have an uploaded yet I want to have this clever name? And I would really be appreciative if one of the ace family members and I can tell you are a real Ace family member, and they have inspired me in so many others and people with them apart and that's okay because hurt people hurt people they are strong and they know they're worth and that they worked hard for this and anyone else can do just what they're doing. Catherine is beautiful and she was worried about it and being on camera she looks gorgeous I literally teared up that woman is amazing I feel like I know her I feel like I've literally known her in a past life it's bizarre it's almost like a knowing I don't know how to explain it but it's a knowing that I have I wish I had on this little Avatar thing I wish it wasn't so complicated now to go back in and change the picture cuz I think Catherine can see it and be like oh okay and put two and two together cuz Catherine is very intuitive and an empath just like me I think she's psychic everyone is psychic by the way in different ways. So please, feel free to give me a creative name and I will definitely shout you out for naming if I like it I promise you that I want everyone to know that we need to all be on the same level there's a there's enough money for all of us to go around money is just a basically an exchange of currency it's energy so start loving money and don't have a you know retrain it that you love money and watch how money starts to flow to you so I will stop I will definitely talk about manifestation too so it's kind of a whole spiritual thing but it's also my life story so if that helps at all and I'm so sorry this is long and I'm just kind of diarrhea of the mouth with voice text right now I know that someone's going to read this and I really appreciate it and I want you guys to help me I want you to be a part of it and I want you to name the channel so I can upload it and you will see what I'm talking about I want to show the world that as one person we literally can make a difference and change because I promise you that I will do whatever I can to help people out no one should be starving and someone and these elites run and tell us what to do and what people walk around nine to five jobs like robots we are slaves literally we're not free in America! the system is awful and they have brainwashed and conditioned us so therefore I want people to know they're worth and that we have lost our inner fire and I'm getting my back and I want to show everyone how to get theirs back because I feel like this new age stuff is really confusing people and scaring people because I believe in God and I want to talk about that with everything else I just want to talk about everything so please help me cuz I'm doing it and I know that someone special is going to give me a very clever name I just feel it thank you so much and God bless you and you all have a very merry Christmas!!!!!",view comment

Whit Stone,25/12/20 16:31:43,0,no,no,"Austin, that was the most genuine beautiful gift ever! I am assuming the drama channels May pick this up and say oh Austin made Catherine be on camera well guess what catherine, I want you to know that you are beautiful and don't pick yourself apart we all get facials or most people do anyways and you are beautiful your face looks so much better than mine when I get official but anyways don't pick yourself apart and don't let people in the comments or anyone ever tell you all that you are not doing what you are doing you all have worked and grinded and you have inspired me and I'm going to upload by January 1st no matter what to help others you all are very genuine and people just cannot stand because there's so much negativity and everyone has been so conditioned and brainwashed by the society and the elites and I'm going to stop right there but that's kind of what I'm going to talk about because literally I literally want to let people know that we have to heal our inner child we all even if we have a good childhood have belief systems because of how we have grown up and even in school and their lies we are all beautiful we all have our own story and please no and I want everyone that's reading this to have a very merry Christmas I know that 2021 is going to be wonderful, God has us all and he has arms wrapped around all of us all around the world. I truly believe that yes there is evil definitely but there is way more good in this world and blessings that can be brought upon everyone if they would just actually do something and I can say this from experience because I have not had the courage to do this but I am now have the courage and I will definitely show you all out because you have been an inspiration to me and don't ever pick yourself apart Catherine and don't worry about being on camera because let me tell you something you are gorgeous without makeup we all are. Society has taught us that beauty is on the only on the outside and we need to teach the youth but that is not true and we all have a story we cannot tell our story especially in the age of technology right now there's no excuse and that is what you all have taught me and I want you to know that I will meet you one day and I will I just want to thank you I really do and everyone else we will all be multi-millionaires I do not think that anyone should be starving in this world I am manifesting and I tell you what we will all be millionaires nobody needs to be a billionaire and have these tears and have middle class and then lower class and poverty it's ridiculous especially in the night United States of America where we literally should be free but we've got people doing nine to five and walking around like robots I'm not saying everybody but we need to awake our souls that is the most important thing and that is what I'm going to be talking about on my channel and my story about overcoming addiction and overcoming losing my son and overcoming losing my soulmate the love of my life that was the father of my children that committed suicide!I literally have red self-help books I have they are so textbook things need to be simplified for these people so that they know that they're not alone and that they can do this I swear if I can do this anyone can do it but I need to simplify it for people because I had to have it simplified for me and I think that I can do it very well and I don't know why I feel so inclined to just keep talking because I'm using voice text but I really I think Catherine will read this and I really want to thank Catherine. She is an amazing soul she's an amazing person inside and out and I hate when I hear people talking about that family. But I also know that these people are hurt and hurt people hurt people unintentionally and their subconscious mind they really are just hurt and I don't know if it makes them feel better for a moment in time but that is not what pure inner peace is and joy and I can actually help people find that and that is what I want to write a book and I'm going to I'm in the middle of it and it will be a best seller cuz I'm going to put it in layman's terms for everybody! Merry Christmas austin, catherine, aaliyah, l, and steel.also your parents and Landon and Shyla everything and the little Celine I love them I know the kids names are spelled wrong but listen I am literally voice texting this and literally thoughts and ideas are just pouring out of me and I feel that I need to do this I feel like someone will read this and understand it I know that Catherine will and I'm going to reach out to you Catherine I feel that I know you I don't know how and it's not through YouTube and I've been watching you ever since you all first uploaded but let me tell you something I really feel that I know you in a past life I really wish that they didn't change that thing and I have to go in and change to put a picture cuz I used to have one but I don't right now I will of course when I fix my YouTube I am thinking of a channel name it needs to be a clever name because I'm not going to put all of my eggs in one basket just like you all have not which is wonderful and think about it I want to talk about addiction grief anything the truth everything so my name is Whitney some people call me Whit I want to clever name though can anyone help me think of a YouTube channel name? Think about it ponder on it please comment and feel free to think about something that would rhyme that would go with spirituality into it intuition I was thinking about Whitney's wisdom I was thinking about. it just needs to be something clever because that way I can put it on all platforms normally and also I have kids I also I'm going to talk about how corrupt the system is I mean I have been in jail not for anything bad guys literally it was silly but it cost me after my soulmate committed suicide they took my rainbow child Gabriel and I have been fighting for him and people were paid off I have proof of all of this and I am going to let people know and I'm getting my son back he is aware of it and this is all working out and it's amazing and beautiful but I had to work on myself that is the most important thing that I could ever tell anyone that is reading this work on yourself love yourself first! Once you love yourself everything falls into place I hate that it took me so long to realize that but I know that I had to go through all of this to basically have empathy for everyone that I'm going to help. I want to start a recovery house and make it affordable for everyone I think that rehab should be accessible to everyone and not be based on if you have money or not and also that's about how the world works and I really want to shed light on this! I just keep talking because I feel like Catherine is going to read this and she's going to reach out I just know it I'm manifesting it so it's going to happen I just know I believe I trust and I want anyone that's reading this to know that they can do whatever they want if you think it and literally believe it you literally can do whatever you want you just have to do it! this is the most wonderful Christmas I've ever had in a long time and I'm so literally grateful and let me tell you I'll gratitude as the key and we do not need to be judgmental to anyone we are all connected we need to literally raise our vibration and I think that's what's happening the collective consciousness is seeing how things are being transparent and the veil is lifting just know that we are all special we all have a story and we all have been brainwashed to think something is beautiful from the outside and everything is outside of us go inward meditate and get to know yourself again because they tell us oh those kids are just using their imagination we should never lose our imagination or our creativity!! God bless all of you!",view comment
